# Project1 

The project built on C language is intended to read and write ppm files in P3, P6 and P7 formats. In the process of conversion the program will be able to handle undefined errors with a prefixed error message. So this program will have the ability to read P3, P6, P7 formatted images into memory and write the user chosen ppm format to an output file.
